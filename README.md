## ðŸš€ Features

* **Built-in adblocker** - Dot Browser automatically blocks advertisements and trackers out of the box so you can get back to what you do best, browsing!
* **Clean and familiar UI** - You won't need to re-invent the wheel to understand the layout.
* **We don't track you** - We've based Dot Browser on the Firefox source code, and we've stripped out all the Mozilla tracking.
* **Sync all your important data to your Dot ID** - You can backup and sync all your browsing history, bookmarks and even passwords.
* **Modify every aspect of the browser** - With the `config` page, you can tweak and fine-tune anything in the browser. 
* **Modern New Tab Page** - Our New Tab page features a search box and the latest news in your area. Anything is customisable.
* **All our code is open-source** - We love transparency, which is why all our code is open-source and publically-available on GitHub.
